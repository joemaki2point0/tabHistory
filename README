tabHistory is a barebones script to create tabs with history support on browsers that support history.pushstate

Required HTML elements:

anchor links that represent each tab with the full path to their target page with the class historyTab.
a div to hold the tabs contents with the id tabBody.

CSS requirements:

a .current class to style the currently active tab

Server side info:
This script was initially written to be used with Joomla!

The pages should only return plain body content when requested via ajax but also needs to be able to load with a template if called directly.

To achieve this we wrap the page in a conditional php statment and check for the HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH header

<?php
if($_SERVER[HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH]){
?>
//plain body content goes here
<?php
}
else{
?>
// full template goes here
